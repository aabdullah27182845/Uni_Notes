**Definition By Tom Mitchell**: A computer program is said to **learn** from **experience** E with respect to some class of **tasks** T and performance measure P, if its **performance** at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. So,
- E is experience
- T are tasks
- P is performance measure.

### Example

Since examples with machine learning are so nuanced and even subjective sometimes, here is an example (possibly oversimplified) of a machine learning program designed for Face Detection:
- E (Experience): image (with bounding boxes) around faces.
- T(Tasks): given an image without boxes, put boxes around faces.
- P (Performance Measure): number of faces correctly identified.
